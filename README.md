# Hi Changeis!

This is my submission for <https://changeis-code-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/SimpleReactCodingChallenge.html>.
It's very simple and hopefully shows I am real.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), which is a React.js framework.

## How to run my application

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
